TypeScript?
Programming language from microsoft
superset of js
Has some additional features on top of javaScript
Javascript with typeChecking

Some of the features:
-> Static Typing:
    statically-typed:(c++, java)
        variable will be initialized with a datatype and cannot be applied with another datatype,
        a static type for a variable
    dynamically-typed:(js, python)
        variable can be applied with another datatype object without error, eg number type variable can be applied with string after, type will be determined or be changed at runtime(leads to problems)

-> Code completion
->Refactoring
->Shorthand notations

Drawbacks:
->Compilation (Transpilation)
->Discipline in coding

Developing Environment:
->node Js
npm i -g typescript
tsc -v

Built In Type:
js: number, string, boolean, null, undefined, object
ts: any, unknown, never, enum, tuple

arrays:
let numbers: number[] = [];

tuples:
let user: [number, string]

enums:
enum size {small = 1, medium, large} /////medium = 2 and large = 3...

Type alias:
just like you did in java eg.Employee and using the type alias for adding in array
