Angular Unit Testing

Jasmine & Karma
Setup & Teardown (cleaning up)
-> beforeAll - called once before all the specs described are runned
-> afterAll - once all the specs are finished running
-> beforeEach - before each "it"(spec) has runned
-> AfterEach - after each "it" function has runned

Karma: command line tool
lets run jasmine test from the cmd line
re runs the tests automatically
lets us use jasmine as part of a development toolchain which requires a cmd line 


use ng test for running test for your angular project

use x before to temporarily disable a spec 
use f before to focus on a spec

jasmine supports Behavior driven development
Test suites =>(Test Specs =>(Test Exceptations))
We can run jasmine from the browser, but usually we run via another tool call karma on the command line

Testing pipe and classes
-> We can test any isolated class with a simple jasmine spec file.
-> You have most of the tools already to write isolated tests for directives, components, pipes and so on
-> However our code often requires other code to work, it has dependencies.

Mocks and Spies 
-> Testing with real dependencies resuls in tight coupling and brittle code.
->The goal is to test pieces of code in isolation
-> We do this by creating Mocks or by using real instances of classes but taking control of them with Spys.
